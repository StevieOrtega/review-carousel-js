 - what is a review carousel, it is a card with a review about the customer 
 - that either enjoyed or hated their service. 

 UI? 
  - 1. i see a card and within that card there is a picture of a customer with a statement 
  - about their personal experience with the company. 
  - 2. under the statement there is a right and left arrow that move the card left and right
  - there should be about 4 customers 
  - 3. when it hits the 4 customer, it should loop back to the first customer if its to the right. 
  - if its the first and they hit the left arrow then it should move to the last customer

  - one will contain the picture and the statment and the other one 
  2. then copy and paste the next employees.
